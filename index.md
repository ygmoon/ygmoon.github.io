## About me

I am currently working at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/), and contributing to the design of next-generation communication systems and relevant solutions. Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I was advised by Prof. [KyoungSoo Park](https://www.ndsl.kaist.edu/~kyoungsoo/). My research interests are broadly in the area of networking and computing systems with a focus on designing scalable and robust systems.
