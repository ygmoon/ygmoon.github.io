## About me

I am currently a Staff Engineer at Samsung Research. Previously, I received my Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I was advised by Prof. [KyoungSoo Park](https://www.ndsl.kaist.edu/~kyoungsoo/). My research interests are broadly in the area of networking and computing systems with a focus on designing scalable and robust systems.
